    "\n",
    "1. Parallelize with MPI libraries your Genetic Algorithm code in order to solve the TSP by performing a *Genetic Search* with (up to) 10 **parallel GA searches of the optimal path**:\n",
    "each node should perform an independent GA search, the so-called *Continent*, **but** every $N_{migr}$ generations the *Continents* should exchange their best individuals randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Starting from your Genetic Algorithm code implement a **Parallel Tempering algorithm** (Simulated Annealing with many temperatures). Parallelize with MPI libraries your algorithm in order to solve the TSP where each computing node, up to 10, is characterized by a different temperature or a limited set of temperatures (if you need more than 10 temperatures). Use your genetic operators (except crossover) as trial moves for the Metropolis algorithm and **add a trial move that proposes an exchange of paths among adjacent temperatures (nodes)** (see lecture 8 for the acceptance formula). The candidate solution of the TSP will appear on the node with the lower temperature."
